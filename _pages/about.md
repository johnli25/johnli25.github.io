I'm a graduate student (M.S./PhD) in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/), advised by [Professor Matt Caesar](https://caesar.cs.illinois.edu/). Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Engineering from UIUC as well. 

My research interests lie in Internet of Things (IoT), Computer Vision (CV), and Machine Learning (ML) for Networking and Systems.
